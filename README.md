🚖 Smart Ride-Sharing Optimizer

A real-world AI + Data Structures project that simulates a ride-sharing system in Hyderabad.
It uses graphs (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) to calculate shortest paths, manages drivers, rides, and queues, and provides a Bootstrap-styled Flask web dashboard.

✨ Features

📍 Hyderabad Location Graph – modeled using adjacency lists.

🚖 Ride Request System – riders can book trips with source/destination.

🧑‍✈️ Driver Management – tracks driver availability and location.

🔗 Shortest Path Calculation – optimized routes using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

💰 Fare Calculation – distance-based pricing system.

⏳ Ride Queue System – unassigned riders wait in a queue until a driver is free.

📊 Interactive Web Dashboard – clean Bootstrap UI to view:

Available drivers

Waiting queue

Active rides
